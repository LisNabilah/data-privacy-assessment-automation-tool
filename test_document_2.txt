Data Processing Agreement

This agreement outlines the responsibilities for data protection between the organization and its service providers. 

All third-party vendors must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) before accessing any personal data. The DPA must include clauses for security measures, sub-processor authorization, and data breach notification procedures.

Data Protection Officer

The organization has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing our privacy compliance program. The DPO can be contacted at privacy@company.com for any data protection inquiries.

Cross-Border Data Transfers

Personal data may be transferred outside Malaysia only when adequate protection measures are in place. We ensure that all international data transfers comply with PDPA requirements and have appropriate safeguards.

Data Retention Schedule

We maintain a data retention schedule that specifies different retention periods for various categories of personal data. Customer data is retained for 7 years after account closure, while employee records are kept for 10 years post-employment.

Security Measures

All personal data is protected with encryption both in transit and at rest. We implement role-based access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

Incident Response

In the event of a data breach, our incident response team will activate within 2 hours and notify affected individuals within 72 hours as required by law.
